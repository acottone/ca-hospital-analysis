Data are reported for January – September 2015 due to coding changes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS for procedures, which began 10/1/2015. Comparisons across years should be made with caution since previous years’ results are based on 12 months of data, while this analysis is based on 9 months of data. The 2015 data may differ from previous years due to the coding change.  For all types of cancer surgeries, except breast cancer, the dataset contains surgeries performed in the inpatient hospital setting.
