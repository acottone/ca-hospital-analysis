  "description": "The dataset contains risk-adjusted mortality rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases for 6 medical conditions treated (Acute Stroke, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Hip Fracture and Pneumonia) and 5 procedures performed (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Unruptured/Open, Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Unruptured/Endovascular, Carotid Endarterectomy, Pancreatic Resection, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in California hospitals. The 2022 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 2023, while previous years' IMIs were generated with older versions of AHRQ software (2021 IMIs by Version 2022, 2020 IMIs by Version 2021, 2019 IMIs by Version 2020, 2016-2018 IMIs by Version 2019, 2014 and 2015 IMIs by Version 5.0, and 2012 and 2013 IMIs by Version 4.5).  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years. This dataset does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings.

The 2014 and 2015 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, the 2012 and 2013 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5 and the 2010 and 2011 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.4. The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time. However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years.
